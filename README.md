# Dimo

Personal spending tracker — expenses, budgets, recurring bills, lending, and stats. Local-first on every platform, with cloud sync through Convex and WorkOS AuthKit.

| Surface | Stack | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web | Next.js 16, React 19, Dexie / IndexedDB | Static export to `out/` |
| Desktop | Electron wrapping the same export | `electron/` |
| iOS | SwiftUI + GRDB SQLite | `app.dimo.ios` · `ios-native/` |
| Android | Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Room | `app.dimo.android` · `android-native/` |

Web, desktop, iOS, and Android share the same Convex backend and WorkOS account. Lending records are created and managed on native iOS and Android, then shown read-only on web and desktop.

## Features

- Log expenses with categories (emoji + optional monthly budget) and payment methods
- Budgets overview and category management
- Recurring monthly / yearly bills (clients + daily Convex cron materialization)
- Activity list, stats ranges, and CSV import / export
- Account sync status, sign-in (Google / Apple via WorkOS), and preferences
- Read-only lending summary and activity on web, desktop, and responsive mobile web
- **Native iOS & Android:** lending tracker with address-book contacts, repayments, and shareable outstanding summaries. Shared summaries list only the current unsettled cycle using signed amounts and `DD-MMM-YYYY` dates. Contact names and IDs sync; photos stay on-device.
- **Native iOS:** Liquid Glass tab UI (iOS 26+); optional Gmail → AI expense / refund suggestions (on-device Local Gemma or user-supplied OpenRouter)

## Architecture

### Local-first data

| Client | Store |
| --- | --- |
| Web / Electron | IndexedDB via Dexie (`dimo-expenses:{WorkOS userId}`) |
| Native iOS | SQLite via GRDB (`dimo-{userId}.sqlite`) |
| Native Android | SQLite via Room (`dimo-{userId}.db`) |

Entity types: `category`, `paymentMethod`, `transaction`, `recurring`, `preferences`, and `lend`. Native iOS and Android own lending writes; web and Electron only pull and display them. Every local write and its outbox op commit together. The web app requires WorkOS + Convex configuration and authentication; native clients remain usable offline and sync when configured.

### Sync

When Convex is linked, the sync coordinator:

1. Upserts workspace `name` / `email` from the signed-in WorkOS user (JWT claims omit these, so clients pass them explicitly)
2. Pulls cloud changes after its durable revision cursor
3. Merges with hybrid logical versions (last-write-wins)
4. Pushes pending outbox ops in idempotent batches
5. Pulls once more to confirm canonical state

Triggers include local writes, reconnect, focus / visibility / foreground, retry timers, and Convex revision notifications. Account → **Sync now** on web clears this app’s owned cloud entity types and re-uploads the local snapshot (web leaves native-only types like `lend` alone unless you wipe the full account). Native **Sync now** is an ordinary sync; full replacement is a separate explicit action.

WorkOS AuthKit authenticates every cloud call. Convex derives ownership from the verified token; each user has an isolated revision stream, a `workspaces` row (revision + profile name/email), and a separate local database.

The empty D1 / Drizzle / worker stubs under `db/`, `drizzle/`, and `worker/` are unused starter leftovers — do not dual-write to them.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`
- Convex account (cloud sync)
- WorkOS AuthKit with Google and Apple social login
- For native iOS: Xcode, [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen), iOS 26 SDK
- For native Android: Android SDK (API 35) and NDK for ConvexMobile

## Local development (web)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Link Convex and provision a managed WorkOS environment:

```bash
npm run convex:dev
```

Keep that process running beside `npm run dev` while changing backend functions. The first run is interactive and writes ignored `.env.local` values.

### Existing WorkOS team

```bash
npx convex env set WORKOS_CLIENT_ID client_...
npx convex env set WORKOS_API_KEY sk_test_...
```

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...
```

In the WorkOS dashboard: enable only Google and Apple under Authentication → Social Login, and allow the callback for every host used to access Dimo (for example, `http://localhost:3000/callback` and `https://saitejas-macbook-pro.tail54df4a.ts.net/callback`).

### Production web build

```bash
npm run convex:deploy
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://YOUR_DEPLOYMENT.convex.cloud npm run build
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` are embedded at build time — set them before hosting or Electron packaging. The authentication callback derives from the browser's current origin.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Next.js dev server |
| `npm run build` | Static export → `out/` |
| `npm test` | Unit tests + production build |
| `npm run test:unit` | Vitest only |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run convex:dev` | Convex dev deployment + codegen |
| `npm run convex:deploy` | Deploy Convex schema/functions |
| `npm run electron:dev` | Next.js + Electron |
| `npm run electron:preview` | Electron on static export |
| `npm run electron:dist` | Package desktop installers |

## Native iOS (`ios-native/`)

SwiftUI client sharing Convex + WorkOS. Full setup: [ios-native/README.md](ios-native/README.md).

```bash
brew install xcodegen
cd ios-native
xcodegen generate
open Dimo.xcodeproj
```

Config: `Config/Debug.xcconfig` / `Release.xcconfig` → Info.plist (`ConvexURL`, `WorkOSClientID`). Register `dimo://callback` on the WorkOS client (public client + PKCE).

App Store listing copy and submission steps: [store/SUBMIT.md](store/SUBMIT.md), `store/listing.json`.

## Native Android (`android-native/`)

Kotlin / Compose client with iOS feature parity (Home, Stats, Budgets, Lending; Recurring from Home / expense editor). Full setup: [android-native/README.md](android-native/README.md). Testing notes: [android-native/TESTING.md](android-native/TESTING.md).

```bash
cd android-native
# create local.properties with sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/sdk
./gradlew :app:assembleProdDebug
./gradlew :app:testProdDebugUnitTest
```

Product flavors `prod` / `dev` set `CONVEX_URL` and `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`. Register `dimo://callback` on the WorkOS public client used for Android.

## Fresh install

A new local database seeds Cash as the default payment method and default preferences only — no starter categories, transactions, or recurring rows. Users add categories themselves (budgets are optional on each category).

Bootstrap defaults are written locally first and only uploaded after the first pull, so a fresh device cannot overwrite existing cloud category budgets with empty seeds.

Clear the `dimo-expenses:*` IndexedDB database in browser tools to simulate a fresh install. Reloading preserves local records and pending sync work.

## Sync troubleshooting

- **Authentication setup required** — a public Convex or WorkOS build variable is missing
- **Offline** — local writes queue and upload when connectivity returns
- **Pending** — ops are in the outbox, not yet acknowledged
- **Error** — open Account for the transport error; retry with **Sync now**
- After schema / binding changes, run `npm run convex:dev` again

Tombstones are retained indefinitely so a long-offline device cannot resurrect deleted data.

## Platform notes

Electron ships the static `out/` export. Sync runs while the process is open; suspended iOS / Android background execution is not included. Prefer separate WorkOS application records per surface (web, desktop, mobile) so each can use the right client ID, redirect URI, and session policy.
